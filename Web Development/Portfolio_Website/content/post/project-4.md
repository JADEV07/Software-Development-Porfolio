In this notebook, I analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. I am going to find the answers to questions like:

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
