title: "Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis of Real World Sales data"
---

For this example project I was given a set of task for a business scenario. 

I use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

This explores 5 high level business questions related to the data: 
* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* What city sold the most product?
* What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
* What products are most often sold together?
* What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
