My name is John Amores and I have been working in the software engineering field doing application development and production support for the last 3 years. I am currently transitioning into the data analytics field as a self-taught data analysis with experience in creating exploratory data analysis and creating data visualization dashboards. I also have a background in the biological sciences as I was lab tech in college. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost, I took courses in various platforms such as datacamp and dataquest. Currently, I am a software engineer workging for a proudction support team within Verizon, in my off time I study to hone my skills in data analytics and other technologies.
